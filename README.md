📖 Overview
The AI-Powered Medical Image Analysis Platform is an end-to-end, cloud-deployed intelligent system designed to assist healthcare professionals in detecting diseases at an early stage through automated medical image analysis. The platform uses machine learning models trained on chest X-ray datasets to classify and identify potential abnormalities with high accuracy.

This project was developed as part of the Adaptive Software Engineering course, demonstrating the integration of Agile development, DevOps practices, security operations, and MLOps within a single production-grade platform.

❗ Problem Statement
Medical professionals are often overwhelmed with large volumes of patient data, leading to:

❌ Delayed diagnoses
❌ Increased risk of human error
❌ Misdiagnosis of critical conditions
❌ Late detection of diseases such as pneumonia
This platform directly addresses these challenges by automating the medical image analysis process, reducing clinician workload while improving diagnostic speed and accuracy.
